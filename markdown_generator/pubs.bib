  abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Events can be defined as an action or a series of actions with a determined theme, time, and place. Recently, event analysis tasks for knowledge extraction from news and social media have been explored. In particular, agribusiness events have multiple components for a successful prediction model. For example, price trend predictions for commodities can be performed through a time series analysis of prices. However, we can also consider events that represent external factors during the training step of predictive models. This paper presents a method for integrating agribusiness news events into trend prediction tasks. First, we propose to model events and time-series information through heterogeneous information networks (HIN) that allow multiple components to be directly modeled through multi-type nodes and edges. Second, we learn features from HIN through network embedding methods, i.e., network nodes are mapped to a dense vector of features. In particular, we propose a network embedding method that propagates the semantics of the pre-trained language models to a heterogeneous information network and evaluates its performance in trend prediction for agribusiness commodities prices. Finally, we propose a second method that leverages the HIN architecture to fine-tune a pre-trained language model before propagation. We show that using our proposed models of language-based embedding propagation is competitive with state-of-art network embeddings algorithms. Moreover, our proposal performs network embedding incrementally, allowing new events to be inserted in the same semantic space without rebuilding the entire network embedding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
